API Backend

🛠️ In Progress

Simulated API key generation is live on the front-end; full backend development required.

💡 Core Purpose

The primary goal of this site is to demonstrate the power of the 10 algorithms and capture sign-ups for the 14-day Free Trial of the Professional Tier.

Key Features of the Site

Dark & Professional Design: Uses Tailwind CSS for a high-end, enterprise aesthetic.

Clear Tier Separation: Boldly distinguishes between Free NPM Code and Paid API Access (Managed Dashboard, SLA, Monitoring).

Conversion Funnel: All major Call-to-Action (CTA) buttons activate a JavaScript-driven Registration Modal to capture user interest and simulate API key delivery.

Single-File Simplicity: The entire site is contained in index.html for easy hosting via GitHub Pages or any static host.

🛠️ Installation and Setup (GitHub Pages)
